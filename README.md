# DOI bot

This branch of the "Citation Bot" or "DOI Bot" is deployed on Wikimedia Labs, [see it here](http://tools.wmflabs.org/doi-bot/). The code repository is available [here](https://github.com/wrought/citation-bot/tree/labs). 

## Purpose

The purpose of this tool is to direct a citation cleaning and DOI-based formatting bot at specific pages. There are various options for quality/speed trade-offs. 

## @TODO
* Need to test, unsure if this works from this location
* Any additional configuration required? 
* Seems the template is not loading, could restore or re-design
* Test category: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Pages_with_incomplete_DOI_references

## Changelog
So far, nothing
